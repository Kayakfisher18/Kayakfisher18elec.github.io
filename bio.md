# FISHFINDERS

The two main types of fishdiners are portable and fixed.  Portable fishfinders are ideal for kayaks and other small watercrafts, while fixed are ideal for larger boats with compartments to house and permanently store these electronic devices.  Fishfinders allow anglers to see a graphic representation of what is beneath their boats so they can identify fish and structure.

The [basic functions of a fishfinder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkGg5rnK4Cc) are color, contour, and auto adjust settings.  Fishfinders need a tranducer to operate utiliizing single, dual or multipule frequencies.  The higher the frequencies produces the most detail, but with not as much depth as a low freq fishfinder.  If fishing shallow water such as lakes or inshore you should choose higher frequencies fishfinder (200kHz -800kHz).  For deep sea fishing 200+ feet of water you should use lower frequencies (50kHz - 80kHz).
