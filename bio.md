# FISHFINDERS

The two main types of fishdiners are portable and fixed.  [Portable fishfinders](https://www.sonarwars.com/best-kayak-fish-finder/) are ideal for kayaks and other small watercrafts, while fixed are ideal for [larger boats](https://www.fishfindly.com/best-fishfinder-gps-combo/) with compartments to house and permanently store these electronic devices.  Fishfinders allow anglers to see a graphic representation of what is beneath their boats so they can identify fish and structure.

The [basic functions of a fishfinder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkGg5rnK4Cc) are color, contour, and auto adjust settings.  Fishfinders need a tranducer to operate utiliizing single, dual or multipule frequencies.  The higher the frequencies produces the most detail, but with not as much depth as a low freq fishfinder.  If fishing shallow water such as lakes or inshore you should choose higher frequencies fishfinder (200kHz -800kHz).  For deep sea fishing 200+ feet of water you should use lower frequencies (50kHz - 80kHz).
