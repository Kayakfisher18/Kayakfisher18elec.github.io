This website covers two of the biggest electonic components in fishing today: [Fish Finders](bio.md) and [Electric Reels](topic.md).  We will take a look at the computers and specs behind some of the leading products on the market today.  Currently the [US Sport Fishing Equipment market](https://www.statista.com/statistics/825236/sports-fishing-equipment-market-value-forecast/) is woth about 701.87 million US dollars.

Both fishfinders and electric reels have wide price ranges from under $200 upwards of several thousand.  When it comes to electronics, not all are created equal, the quality of the components inside the electronics will often drive prices.  Higher quality internals usually result in faster performance and higher resoulution immages which should equal more fish (wishfull thinking).
